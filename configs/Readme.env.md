## Notes on gofr config files

In general, config files can contain passwords or other secret information. 
As such, I am only including empty .env files in the repo here with the exception
of configs/.sample.local.env as a sample to help you get a local dev environment up and running quickly.

For more info on setting up config files for your different run environments, 
see the [official Gofr documentation](https://gofr.dev/docs/quick-start/configuration)
